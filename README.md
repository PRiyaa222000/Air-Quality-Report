# Air-Quality-Report
I’m excited to share a project I’ve been working on to monitor and analyze air quality! Using Power BI, I’ve built a dynamic and interactive Air Quality Report to track pollutant levels across various cities.

Key Features:
>KPIs for Key Pollutants: I’ve calculated the average levels of gases like CO, NO, SO₂, and PM₂.₅ to give a clear snapshot of air quality.
>City-Specific Analysis: With a Slicer, users can filter the report by city to focus on local air quality.
>Stacked Bar Chart: A visual comparison of the Top 3 most polluted and least polluted cities based on pollutant levels.
>Map Visualization: Geospatial data for specific locations, with tooltips to provide additional context on air quality at the city level.
>Trend Analysis: A Line Chart that shows the yearly trend of the AQI (Air Quality Index) to identify long-term air quality improvements or deteriorations.
>DAX Queries: Used for advanced calculations to bring actionable insights, such as rolling averages and threshold comparisons.

This report not only helps visualize air quality trends but also empowers users to take informed actions to prevent the degradation of air quality and improve public health. 
India continues to face significant challenges when it comes to air quality, with many cities ranking among the most polluted globally. In light of this, it has become more crucial than ever to understand and analyze the Air Quality Index (AQI) to make informed decisions that can help prevent further degradation of air quality.
Using data visualization tools like Power BI, we can gain valuable insights into the current state of air quality and the impact of key pollutants like CO, NO, SO₂, and PM₂.₅. By analyzing these trends, we can identify the most affected areas and take targeted actions to improve public health and reduce pollution.
 This report is a step toward data-driven decision-making for urban planning, environmental policy, and public health initiatives.
I’m excited to continue using data visualization tools like Power BI to help tackle environmental challenges.
